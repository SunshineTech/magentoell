@todo:
- Check/get with Madhavi
    - Order flow for all websites

    - Customer AX ID: maintained only for EEUS (when customer places an order and a rep works on it) and ERUS (when retailer account is activated). SZUK used to maintain it but no longer (some may have it; others may not). SZUS does not have it. Essentially, if available, write it; otherwise, no need. Sames values for "invoice_account", for the most part.

    - Amounts in respective currencies? yes.
    - "tax" node: UK only values? "tax_amount" node unclear.

    - Shipping: FedEx for all websites, except USPS used for for APO, FPO, Hawaii, Alaska, etc.
        - All orders get FXGround sent.. but ERUS has its own list of methods available; refer to the document.

    - delivery_zone? This is sent back from FedEx.
    - delivery_mode? Don't see them in shipping document, except for ERUS.
    - delivery_term: "always "PP" but if Retailer (ERUS website) used Collect shiping then code should be "CC""?

    - All shipping carrier accounts and credentials for real rates: Get it from Madhavi.

    - Cybersource sandbox credential. Also need web login. Below has no p/w.
        http://ebctest.cybersource.com
        merchant name: sizzix
        user name: abassi
        - Need to install the extension first and see what fields are required to use this payment.
        - Only US website use this. UK uses Sagepay.

    - Need detailed timestamp format on file: It can be anything, really.

    - The third-party file transfer program moves the files when transferring them.

    - What happens if an order is sent more than once to AX? Not a big deal. AX has its own filtering.

    - How frequent? Every 2 hours for all files, but they have different minutes.

    - For the next dev, work on the inventory update for Madhavi, so she can start QAing.

    - Outlet price is only for SZUS -> becomes special price. Wholesale also but for ERUS.
