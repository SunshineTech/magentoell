Once college bound, she pursued art and design at Brigham Young University. She combined this passion for art with her love of nostalgia by opening an antique and jewelry shop in 1991, while raising her four children. For 10 years, Wendy worked with metals and broke through creatively when she and her sister Jeanne discovered the creative filigree settings technique. With this unique innovation, she formed Vintaj Design Studios and eventually co-founded Vintaj Natural Brass Co. Her life experiences have prepared her well to serve as President of this amazing company.</<p>"
